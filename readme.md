## Backend Assignment: 
Simple Todos on Board API The assignment involves the creation of a Todo on different boards via REST JSON API using ASP.NET Core. Please use the following libraries and versions:
   - ASP.NET Core 5.0+

## Todos on Board API: 
We want to create RESTful APIs for a simple Todo management application. The APIs will perform CRUD operation for Todos and Boards. Todos are organized in boards, on every board there can be multiple Todos. A Todo contains a title (str), done (bool), a created (datetime) and updated (datetime) timestamp. A board has a name (str).

Via a REST API it must be possible to:
- List all boards
- Add a new board 
- Change a board's title 
- Remove a board 
- List all Todos on a board 
- List only uncompleted Todos 
- Add a Todo to a board 
- Change a Todo's title or status 
- Delete a Todo 

User management and authentication is a plus. The data have to be persisted in SQL Server using EF Core.
